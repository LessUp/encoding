# Bibliography

This document collects classic papers, authoritative textbooks, and related open source projects in the field of compression algorithms, providing academic references for in-depth researchers.

## Classic Papers

### Huffman Coding

[^huffman1952]: Huffman, D. A. (1952). "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes". *Proceedings of the IRE*. 40 (9): 1098–1101.

> The original paper on Huffman coding, proposing a greedy algorithm for constructing optimal prefix codes. Huffman completed this work while pursuing his PhD at MIT, and the algorithm is still widely used today.

[DOI: 10.1109/JRPROC.1952.273898](https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1952.273898)

### Arithmetic Coding

[^risanen1976]: Rissanen, J. (1976). "Generalized Kraft Inequality and Arithmetic Coding". *IBM Journal of Research and Development*. 20 (3): 198–203.

> The theoretical foundation of arithmetic coding, showing how to encode an entire message as a single numerical value approaching the entropy limit.

[DOI: 10.1147/rd.203.0198](https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.203.0198)

[^langdon1984]: Langdon, G. G., & Rissanen, J. (1984). "Compression of Black-White Images with Arithmetic Coding". *IEEE Transactions on Communications*. 32 (6): 658–666.

> Application of arithmetic coding in image compression, demonstrating its advantages in practical scenarios.

### Range Coding

[^martin1979]: Martin, G. N. N. (1979). "Range Encoding: the Same as Arithmetic Coding, Only Different". *Unpublished manuscript*.

> The original paper on range coding, showing how to implement arithmetic coding using integers to avoid floating-point precision issues.

### Information Theory Foundations

[^shannon1948]: Shannon, C. E. (1948). "A Mathematical Theory of Communication". *Bell System Technical Journal*. 27 (3): 379–423.

> The foundational work of information theory, defining the concept of entropy and establishing the theoretical lower bound for lossless compression.
