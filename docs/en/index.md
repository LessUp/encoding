## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LessUp/compress-kit.git
cd compress-kit
make build && make test
```

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Best For | Speed |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| [Huffman](/en/algorithms/huffman) | General purpose, text | Fast |
| [Arithmetic](/en/algorithms/arithmetic) | Maximum compression | Medium |
| [Range Coder](/en/algorithms/range) | Production systems | Fast |
| [RLE](/en/algorithms/rle) | Repetitive data | Very Fast |

## Cross-Language Compatibility

Encode in C++, decode in Go. Encode in Rust, decode in C++. All implementations produce identical binary output.

```bash
# C++ encode, Go decode
./cpp/huffman encode input.txt output.huf
./go/huffman decode output.huf decoded.txt
# Works perfectly — same bytes, different languages
```
